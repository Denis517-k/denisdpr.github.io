## Deep Learning in Geological Fault Analysis
I am working on a Japanese government funded SATREPS-JICA [project]( http://aicd-africa.org/archives/3061?fbclid=IwAR0RYryEy0AwcEidAAH-Aey_vSypQ5wkF76AzCtTjHhZA_3Xhgwk8AzuAYs). 
In This Collaborative work, we are integrating remote sensing and GIS based images in deep learning algorithms for land surface fault detection in semi-arid lands in Djibouti. Results are development of deep learning models to aid in underground water cycle simulation models and creation of water resource potential maps in semi-arid lands in  Djibouti to enhance economic production.
