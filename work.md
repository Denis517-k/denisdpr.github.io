## AI Integration to enhance production
As Applied Data scientist, my past doctoral research focused mainly on integration of ICT and AI to 
enhance tomato production in low-resourced communities. The work targeted Sub-Sahara Africa and Japan.
This work is based on using agro-informatics sensor data analytics techniques, 
deep learning and machine learning models, applied data science, GIS and remote sensing techniques and tools.

## Ongoing work
I am working on a Japanese government funded SATREPS-JICA [project]( http://aicd-africa.org/archives/3061?fbclid=IwAR0RYryEy0AwcEidAAH-Aey_vSypQ5wkF76AzCtTjHhZA_3Xhgwk8AzuAYs). 
In This Collaborative work, we are integrating remote sensing and GIS based images in deep learning algorithms for land surface fault detection in semi-arid lands in Djibouti. Results are developmed deep learning models to aid in underground water cycle simulation models and creation of water resource potential maps in semi-arid lands in  Djibouti to enhance economic production.
