## <strong>Research Summary</strong>
<div style="text-align:left"><span style="color:black; font-family:Georgia;">
This research thesis is structured into six Chapters including the general introduction
as Chapter 1 and the general conclusion as Chapter 6 to address the summary of all chapters.

In Chapter 2, we focused at the problem of abiotic factors (herein microclimate)
of labor constrained small-scale farmers in Japan. The approach based on ICT
technological transfer of smart agriculture system to labor constrained small-scale
horticultural farmers to improve tomato production management. The solution to this 
was applied usage and deployment of a wireless sensor network. The real-time information 
composed of commercial inexpensive wireless sensor network devices and
developed database for crop environment monitoring and management.

In Chapter 3, we studied factors to enhance impactful use of computer vison based
early detection approach to tackle tomato pest <em> Tuta absoluta (T.absoluta</em>). A
comprehensive study of the demography and farmer information flow was done in
the areas mostly affected by *T.absoluta*. We examined tomato farmers knowledge on
tomato pest *T.absoluta* damage that could be used to devise recommended platform for
introduction of computer vision (CV) based approach to tackle *T. absoluta*. With the
field experiments we carried out, we showed a high correlation of decreased marketable
tomato due to *T.absoluta* damages. Therefore to solve this problem, a need for early
detection was required which was the basis for Chapter 4 and 5.

In Chapter 4, we detailed the need for early pest detection for effective management
option at early stages of tomato production to avoid economic losses. The main goal
was to develop computer vision based tomato pest early identification and quantification
tools that could be used to strengthen phytosanitary capacity and systems for effective
management option of *T.absoluta*. In this Chapter, the specific researchâ€™s objectives
was: (1) to develop a *T.absoluta* early identification Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) model under commonly practiced agriculture practices. (2) to develop early
detection and quantification CNN models for tomatoes infested by *T.absoluta* damage
characteristics and quantification to enhance early detection.

In Chapter 5, we focused on using multispecral image analysis to investigate spectral
characteristics and applied in detection of *T.absoluta* infested tomato plants under
commonly practices agriculture practices using gradient boosting approach. Results
showed that the CatBoost model of vegetation index NDVI, GNDi, NRI, and MARI
imafeg could be used to detect diseased leaves. Further, Tree Explainer algorithm
adopted on SHAP values showed that NDVI and GNDI were the indicators with the
highest contribution to the trained model, and that NIR reflection information would be
effective in detectiong tomato pestTutaabsolutadamage.

In the final Chapter 6 of the work, we draw conclusions and recommendations based on
previous Chapters that focused on the integration of ICT and artificial intelligence
techniques to enhance tomato production based on a data driven emerging technological
approach.
