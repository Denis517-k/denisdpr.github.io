<div style="text-align:left"><span style="color:black; font-family:Georgia;">
 I'm an Applied Data scientist with expertise in machine learning and deep learning. I completed my Ph.D. in Agricultural Engineering at Tokyo University of Agriculture, focusing on integrating ICT and AI to enhance tomato production in low-resourced communities targeting Sub-Sahara Africa and Japan. Before that, I did my BSc International Agricultural and Food Studies and MSc Agribusiness Management, majoring in Information Management at Tokyo University of Agriculture. I am passionate about seeing a change in struggling communities using agro-informatics, deep learning, applied data science, GIS, and remote sensing techniques and tools. 
I have worked with a wide range of data-driven projects in collaborative teams locally and internationally during my career. 
Because I stopped playing rugby, you'll find me enjoying running, ping me we do a virtual marathon.
